## About

Sitecore Publish Reporting Kit (SPRK) is a tool for logging all publishing activity in Sitecore at the item level.

* Current version: 1.0.0
* About & Download: [SPRK (www.brandonbruno.com)](https://www.brandonbruno.com/sections/development/sprk.html)

## Features

* Provides detailed log files for publishing operations in Sitecore.
* Provides detailed information about each item published, including:
  * Publish mode (incremental / full)
  * Username
  * Item ID
  * Publish result (success / fail / etc.)
  * Source database
  * Target database
  * Date/time of publish
* Configuration of log location and filename.

## Requirements

* .NET 4.5.2 or greater
* Sitecore 8.2 or greater (tested on 8.2, 8.2.4, 8.2.6, 9.0.0)

## Getting Started

#### 1. Installation ####

SPRK is installed via a Sitecore package zip file. Install the package "Sitecore Publish Reporting Kit 1.0.0.zip" in the instance of Sitecore that handles content publishing. This is most likely your content management instance.

#### 2. Configuration ####

After installing the package, open the following configuration file and be sure it is configured for your environment:

```
\App_Config\Include\SitecoreSpark\SPRK\SitecoreSpark.SPRK.Settings.config
```

The following settings are available:

* **`SitecoreSpark.SPRK.Enabled`** - enables / disables the SPRK publish logging altogether
* **`SitecoreSpark.SPRK.LogFolder`** - path where publish logs should be written; by default, this will be Sitecore's default location for logs ("dataFolder/logs/")
* **`SitecoreSpark.SPRK.LogPrefix`** - filename prefix for log files; all log files are appended with a dateformat (yyyyMMdd)

The default values provided should work for most Sitecore environments.

#### 3. Verify the Installation ####

To verify that the module is working properly, ensure that you see the expected log file appear once a publish is complete. If using default settings, you should see "SPRK.log.YYYYMMDD.txt" ('YYYYMMDD' matching today's date) in your Sitecore log folder.

## Troubleshooting 

If you don't see a log file after publishing, open the ShowConfig.aspx utility and verify that the following changes were made to `<sitecore>` configuration:

Pipelines processors added under the `<publish>` node:

```
SitecoreSpark.SPRK.Publishing.Pipelines.Publish.PublishLoggerStartProcessor
SitecoreSpark.SPRK.Publishing.Pipelines.Publish.PublishLoggerEndProcessor
```

Pipeline processors added under the `<publishItem>` node:

```
SitecoreSpark.SPRK.Publishing.Pipelines.PublishItem.PublishLoggerProcessor
```

Configurator added under the `<services>` node:

```
SitecoreSpark.SPRK.SparkConfigurator
```

## Other Notes
SPRK does NOT log items published through the [Sitecore Publishing Service](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Publishing_Service.aspx). Yet.

Any possible errors and exceptions generated by SPRK will be logged in the standard Sitecore diagnostics log.

## Upcoming Features
These features are planned for upcoming releases, but this list is subject to change at any time.

* **Admin reporting**. View/sort/find log data from inside Sitecore with an admin report.
* **Log customization**. Choose what fields appear in your publish log via Sitecore configuration.
* **Automated reporting**. Hook into the publish logging process and fire off reports (email, etc.) when certain conditions are met.
* **NuGet Package**. Make SPRK deployable from your solution.
* **More Support**. Backport to Sitecore 8.0, 8.1.
